## AI Touchpoints

We are introducing two near-term AI features for ShopLite:

- **Typeahead Suggestions**: helps users quickly find products while typing in the search bar.  
- **Support Assistant**: answers common customer questions about orders and policies via chat.  

Both features have low integration risk and are expected to improve key metrics (conversion, support load).  

See details in [AI Capability Map](/docs/ai-first/ai-capability-map.md).
